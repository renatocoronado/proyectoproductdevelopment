"Awful place, I never thought I could have such a bad time in a restaurant. The really need to improve service for non locals, they we're very rude! Very disappointed with this poor experience"
I liked it a lot! very nice service and food was delicious. Music on point and great to have a friends meeting
"very bad experience, food was cold and it took an hour to arrive, also they gave us the worst table in place"
"Excelente place for having a family gathering. Food was really good and price was just right for what we got, loved it!"
"I will recomend this restaurant to everyone I know. I am also coming back next time I'm in town, best place I got to go when traveling this city"
"The soups and drinks are really out of this world, many flavors and very well balanced mixes, they know what they are doing, so I give them a thumbs up"
